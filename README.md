# Bangkok Express

It is my final project for the JS-for-Programmers course, which was
successfully accepted and I received a certificate of completion. The project is
a simple food aggregator from restaurants in Bangkok (the city was chosen
randomly), utilizing modern technologies such as HTML5, CSS3 (including --var),
and JavaScript ES6 + Modules. The project is available for download and can be
run and explored by anyone interested, just open index.html on your local server.
